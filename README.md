## THE SURVEY
Health and Lifestyles Survey (HLS) data was first collected in 2008 by the Health Sponsorship Council (HSC). Before 2008 the HSC had a range of standalone surveys including Smokefree/Auahi Kore Monitor, Gaming and Betting Activities Survey and the Sun Protection Triennial Survey. In 2008, these surveys were combined into one survey - the HLS.

Face-to-face interviews for the HLS have been completed every two years since 2008.

The main target populations are adults aged 15 years and over, and parents and caregivers of 5 to 16-year-old children living in permanent private dwellings in New Zealand. Each survey year monitors changes in attitudes, knowledge and behaviours, and tracks changes in views about the social desirability and acceptability of various measures. The HLS includes questions about gambling, tobacco, alcohol, sun exposure, nutrition, mental health, and physical activity. Sections and questions vary across the survey years.

## KUPE - THE DATA EXPLORER
Kupe presents results from the most recent survey, as well as changes over time for adults aged 15 years and over. Kupe aims to answer the following questions for each reported indicator:

What is the prevalence (percentage) and estimated number of people affected, or what is the average (mean) for the total population and population subgroups?
How do the indicators vary by sex, age, ethnicity, or neighbourhood deprivation? Ratios are used to compare males with females, Māori with non-Māori, Pacific with non-Pacific, and people living in most deprived versus least deprived areas. Ratios are adjusted for differences in age, sex, and prioritised ethnicity.
What has changed over time? Where possible, we present results for all available years of the HLS to identify significant changes over time.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Kupe was developed by EPI-interactive and the Health Promotion Agency | Te Hiringa Hauora (HPA). HPA appreciates precedents shared from the Annual Data Explorer, which was co-developed by EPI-interactive and the Health and Disability Intelligence Unit at the Ministry of Health.

Data used in Kupe would not have been available without the support and enthusiasm of many individuals, including the people who gave their valuable time to participate in the HLS and the interviewers collecting the data.
